Project Repository
------------------

https://github.com/elektropay/app

Elektropay C2E (Cloud Commerce Engine) provides an expressive, fluent interface to global payment providers, payment networks, banks, subscription billing services, bitcoin and other coin providers.

It handles almost all of the boilerplate billing services and product management code that you are dreading writing. In addition to basic subscription management, Elektropay can handle one-off charges, coupons, swapping subscription, subscription "quantities", cancellation grace periods, integrated product management, export payment data to xls, xml, txt and even generate invoice PDFs.

Uses jQuery, Less, PHP(>=5.9.3), Javascript, Devise, MySQL, and Bootstrap.
